In firefox, I found that attempting to move things didn't work.
Initially I thought the problem was due to firefox rendering things
differently (not recognizing the change to the DOM element), but this 
was wrong. The issue was that the css text rule, user select, 
had not been disabled
for mozilla (-moz-user-select). This has been fixed.

Moral: Be wary of browser specific extensions. Use all browser versions.

Update: No, this didn't fix the problem. In fact, the trick that I used in 
Chrome, just putting unselectable into the fraction_bar area, doesn't
stop fractions (which are just child nodes of the fraction area) from being 
text selected. I have now added this explicitly to the fraction class.

Update2: Yes, this did fix the problem. A new issue was introduced 
(change_color got added, but the invocation was wrong). The reason why this
happens I believe is becase the mouse move object that is being targeted
is the selection (which doesn't have a 'left' or 'top' value).

Update3: Fixed the change_color invocation issue, this remains unfortunately.

Update4: The real culprit here is that chrome supports event.x, whereas 
Firefox supports only (standards compliant) event.clientX. This has now
been corrected.

tag.style.background is going to be undefined (or "") since this was not being
set explicitly. Because of that, it was a computed property. This has been
fixed now.
