In firefox, I found that attempting to move things didn't work.
Initially I thought the problem was due to firefox rendering things
differently (not recognizing the change to the DOM element), but this 
was wrong. The issue was that the css text rule, user select, 
had not been disabled
for mozilla (-moz-user-select). This has been fixed.

Moral: Be wary of browser specific extensions. Use all browser versions.
